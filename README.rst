=============

argparse-deco is basically syntatic sugar for argparse using
decorators. Although it inherited some ideas and concepts from
Kevin L. Mitchell's **cli_tools**
(https://github.com/klmitch/cli_tools), it does not share its source
code.

Its main difference is the possibility to abuse Python's class
syntax to define complex CLI tools with nested subcommands.
